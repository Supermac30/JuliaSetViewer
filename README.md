# JuliaSetViewer
A fractal viewer to visualize fixed points. Try it here [Julia Set Viewer (supermac30.github.io)](https://supermac30.github.io/Games/Julia Set Viewer/index.html).

## Purpose
Created to analyze the functions I talked about in [Infinite Recursion And It's Limits (supermac30.github.io)](https://supermac30.github.io/BlogPosts/Infinite Recursion And It's Limits.html). Also they are seriously cool.

Here is a catalogue of interesting fractals created with this tool [Fractals and Stable Solutions (supermac30.github.io)](https://supermac30.github.io/BlogPosts/Fractals and Stable Solutions.html).

## Functionality
- After putting in a function a corresponding Julia set will be created.
- You are able to filter out solutions to see patterns created by each one.
- You can zoom in and out and change the resolution of the picture.

All code is run on the client.
