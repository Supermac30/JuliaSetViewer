# JuliaSetViewer
A fractal viewer to visualize fixed points. Try it here [Julia Set Viewer (supermac30.github.io)](https://supermac30.github.io./Games/Julia%20Set%20Viewer/index.html).

## Purpose
Given an arbitrary equation, this tool find the fixed points and plots them on the complex plain. The faster the convergence, the darker the plot.

Here is a catalogue of interesting fractals created with this tool [Fractals and Stable Solutions (supermac30.github.io)](https://supermac30.github.io./BlogPosts/Fractals%20and%20Stable%20Solutions.html).

## Functionality
- After putting in a function a corresponding Julia set will be created.
- You are able to filter out solutions to see patterns created by each one.
- You can zoom in and out and change the resolution of the picture.

All code is run on the client.
