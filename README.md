# JuliaSetViewer
A fractal viewer to visualise fixed points.

## Purpose
Created to analyse the functions I talked about in [here](https://funonabun.tk/BlogPosts/Infinite%20Recursion%20And%20It's%20Limits.html). Also they are seriously cool.

## Functionality
- After putting in a function a corresponding julia set will be created.
- You are able to filter out solutions to see patterns created by each one.
- You can zoom in and out and change the resolution of the picture.

All code is run on the client.
